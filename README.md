# Bank Loan Data Analysis Using SQL & Power BI

Introduction:
The Bank Loan Portfolio Analysis project aims to provide comprehensive insights into the bank's loan portfolio using SQL queries and Power BI visualization tools. By leveraging these technologies, we seek to enhance decision-making processes, mitigate risks, and optimize loan management strategies.

Project Objectives:

1. Analyze the bank's loan portfolio to understand the distribution of loans across different categories (e.g., mortgage, personal loans, business loans).
2. Evaluate the performance of loans based on various metrics such as default rates, repayment patterns, and profitability.
3. Identify trends and patterns within the loan portfolio to support strategic planning and forecasting.
4. Develop interactive dashboards in Power BI for dynamic visualization of key metrics and trends.
5. Generate actionable insights to optimize lending practices, manage risks, and improve overall portfolio performance.

Tools And Technologies Used:
1. PostgreSQL Version-15.1
2. Power BI Desktop   Version-2.1
Data Sources:

Internal bank databases containing loan information including borrower details, loan amounts, interest rates, repayment terms, and loan status.

Methodology:

1. Data Extraction: Extract relevant loan data from the bank's databases using SQL queries. This includes retrieving information on loan types, borrower demographics, repayment histories, and any other pertinent variables.
2. Data Transformation: Cleanse and transform the extracted data to ensure consistency and accuracy. This may involve handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and aggregating data for analysis.
3. Data Analysis: Utilize SQL queries to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), calculate key performance indicators (KPIs), and uncover insights into loan portfolio dynamics, risk profiles, and profitability.
4. Visualization: Develop interactive and visually appealing dashboards using Power BI to present findings effectively. Dashboards may include charts, graphs, and tables to convey trends, patterns, and comparisons within the loan portfolio.
5. Interpretation and Insights: Interpret the analysis results to derive actionable insights that can inform decision-making processes related to loan management, risk mitigation, and portfolio optimization.

Deliverables:

1. Comprehensive analysis report detailing key findings, insights, and recommendations.
2. Interactive dashboards in Power BI for visualizing loan portfolio metrics and trends.
3. Documentation of SQL queries and data transformation processes for reproducibility and future reference.

Expected Outcomes:

1. Enhanced understanding of the bank's loan portfolio composition, performance, and risk exposure.
2. Identification of opportunities to optimize lending practices, improve credit risk assessment, and enhance portfolio diversification.
3. Empowerment of stakeholders with actionable insights for making informed decisions related to loan management and portfolio optimization.
